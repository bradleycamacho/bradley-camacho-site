Hello! I've had a few blogs like this over the years. I always post a few peices of writing and they die off due to my lack of focus. Chances are this one will too.

Regardless, I love being able to look back at every blog I've ever written as a looking glass into what I was like at that point in time. My first article, in my first ever blog, was about how we *shouldn't* read Frankenstein in AP lang. Right after that, you'd find a post ranking axe body sprays.

In college a lot of my posts were just extended version of essays I wrote for classes. You saw a bit of my interests, myself, seep through; but my writing lost a lot of personality and curiosity.

I'm hoping the short time this blog will recieve my attention will highlight more curiosty, earnestness, and sincerity that college Brad. Go Dawgs.

Anyways, who am I exactly?

My name is Bradley Camacho. I grew up in a suburb of Atlanta, studied english at UGA, and now work as a Technical Writer for New Relic in Portland. I live with my partner and our two cats. I love coffee, my kitchen, and have a new found interest in teas. I am scared of not living up to my potential and hope I can work to engage and improve my local community. I grew up thinking I'm an introvert, but have realized that I'm just quiet - not introverted. I have a pretentious taste in practically any interest. I try not to be annoying about it anymore after realizing how much I hated other people like me. I love sours and pilsners. I'll smoke a cigarette only when drunk. I love drinking with friends, but I hate going to bars unless I'm already drunk. I miss the Southeast, but love the fact that I'm not there. Southeastern by Jason Isbell is one of my favorite albums of all time. Other great albums I've recently been into are Blonde on Blonde, Songs, By the time i got Pheonix, and Twin Fantasies. I'm the worst latino you've ever met. That used to bother me, but I've learned to own my identity. I'm trying to grow as much as possible. Hopefully when I look back a this blog in the future, I'll realize I have ;)
